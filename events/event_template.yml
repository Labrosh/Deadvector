id: ELEC-000               # unique ID (string). ELEC can be replaced with any mechanical prefix, using a 4 letter code. EG: MECH, PLUM, etc, followed by a dash and unique 3 digit number (easiest to use sequentially)
name: Power Bus Fault     # name of the event (string) name of the event, less code and more human readable - potentially the id is in a manual, and this is the title of the event
type: Electrical          # type of event (string) again, might be used in potential manual - or an easy way to search events/list them
subsystem: Engine Bay      # where it happens (free text) - this will corospond to the location in the ship - which is a free text field, but should be consistent with the ship map
description: >-                # description of the event (free text) This will be the short description of the event that appears in the event log
  A power bus fault has been detected in the engine bay.

ai_opening: >-           # what the ships onboard AI says when the event triggers (free text) this will be more helpful or less helpful depending on the difficulty level (To be implemented)
  Uh‑oh—power bus fault detected.
