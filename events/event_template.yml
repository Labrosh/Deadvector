# Dead Vector Event Template
# --------------------------
# Required Fields (all must be populated):

# Unique identifier (4-letter system prefix + 3 digits)
# Number sequentially within each prefix group:
# Example: ELEC-001, ELEC-002, PLUM-001, PLUM-002
id: PREFIX-000

# Human-readable title for manuals/logs
# Example: "Power Bus Fault", "Coolant Leak"
name: Event Name

# Broad category for filtering/organization
# Example: Electrical, Mechanical, Structural, Biological
type: SystemType

# Ship area where event occurs (must match ship map)
# Example: Engine Bay, Bridge, Cargo Hold, Jump Spine Chamber
subsystem: Location

# Impact level - affects damage and time pressure
# Options: Minor, Major, Critical
severity: Minor

# Event Description (appears in logs)
description: >-
  Brief technical description of the malfunction.
  Example: "A power bus fault has been detected in the engine bay."

# AI Responses by Difficulty Level
difficulty:
  easy: >-
    Detailed diagnostic information with clear instructions.
    Example: "Color-coded wires C & D appear fused at junction box 12B."
  medium: >-
    Moderate diagnostic hints requiring some expertise.
    Example: "Scorched leads near the forward bus suggest cascading failure."
  hard: >-
    Minimal information - requires expert troubleshooting.
    Example: "Power bus fault detected. No further data available."

# AI Initial Alert (what the ship's AI says when event triggers)
ai_opening: >-
  The AI's initial announcement when event triggers.
  Example: "Uh-ohâ€”power bus fault detected."

# Outcome Narrations (what the AI says for each result type)
narration:
  critical_success: >-
    Exceptional success (roll >= threshold + 7)
    Example: "You not only fix the bus but optimize the entire power grid!"
  success: >-
    Standard success (roll >= threshold)
    Example: "Engines hum back to life with steady power flow."
  partial_success: >-
    Mixed result (threshold - 5 <= roll < threshold)
    Example: "The bus is patched but you notice another fault developing..."
  fail: >-
    Failure (roll < threshold - 5)
    Example: "Engines offline with a thunk! The failure cascades."

# Optional Fields:

# ID of chained follow-up event (leave blank if none)
# Example: ELEC-002 (for cascading failures)
follow_up: EVENT-XXX
